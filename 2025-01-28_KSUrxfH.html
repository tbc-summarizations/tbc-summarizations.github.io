<h1>summary for 2025-01-28</h1>
<div class="discord-text"><strong>(Podcast intro music fades)</strong>

<strong>Meeth:</strong> (Energetic, almost manic)  Yo, Redacted!  What's up, fam?  Feeling the aura today?

<strong>Redacted:</strong> (Calm, slightly amused)  Just chilling, Meeth.  Not much going on in my aura-spectrum today.  Besides, you're the one radiating a thousand billion auras.  Like, what's your aura-level? 9,999,999,999?

<strong>Meeth:</strong> (Beaming)  999,999,999!  I can feel it vibrating right through the walls! You know? The <em>subtle</em> aura-throbs!

<strong>(Sound of a sudden, sharp electronic beep)</strong>

<strong>Adam:</strong> (A nervous, slightly robotic voice)  Uh...hey. I...uh...I joined.  Is this... a good idea?  My special sandals are getting a little...unstable.  I'm... feeling a little bit... <em>under the ground</em>.


<strong>Meeth:</strong> (Eyes widening)  Adam! You're here!  Perfect.  Now, you're going to feel the full force of my aura.  This is a show and tell for aura mastery, the perfect stage!

<strong>Redacted:</strong>  (Dryly)  Show and tell?  More like show-and-get-a-headache-from-all-the-vibrations.

<strong>Adam:</strong> (Slightly panicked)  I...I'm feeling a... a <em>very</em> strange pressure... My sandals are doing the worm, but in reverse. Like, <em>downward</em>.


<strong>Meeth:</strong> (Laughing)  This is just the beginning, Adam!  Prepare for the aura-blast!  Aura-wave one!  Feel the intense, concentrated aura flow!  (A low, resonant hum fills the air)  <em>Aura-wave two!</em>


<strong>Redacted:</strong> (Slightly wincing)  Meeth, you're turning my aura-meter into a dial-up modem.

<strong>Adam:</strong> (Voice cracking)  I...I can't... I think... I'm going to... well, I'm going around 6 feet underground and my sandals won't support me! This is a different kind of pressure!


<strong>Meeth:</strong> (Boasting)  That's just the <em>beginning</em> of the aura-spectrum!  Now I unleash the <em>Mega-Aura-Mega-Blast-Max-Level-Ultra-Aura-Xtreme-Aura-Blowdown-Mega-Bomb!</em> (A blinding white light erupts, accompanied by the sound of a thousand tiny explosions)


<strong>Redacted:</strong> (Deadpan)  Okay, I think my aura-shield just overloaded.  You might wanna dial that down a notch, Meeth.

<strong>Adam:</strong> (Whispering, barely audible)  I... I think I'm just...  <em>disappearing</em>.  My sandals are no match for this... this... this <em>aura-mageddon!</em>


<strong>Meeth:</strong> (Triumphantly)  See?  I told you my aura was unmatched!  Now, what shall we discuss next?


<strong>(Sound of a gentle, almost serene chime, as the podcast intro music begins to subtly return.)</strong>

<strong>Redacted:</strong>  (With a sigh)  Maybe we should talk about something less...  aura-intensive.  Like, the weather?

<strong>Adam:</strong> (Still barely audible, but now with a note of resignation)  I think I'm... back on the surface.  Just... about to start shaking.
