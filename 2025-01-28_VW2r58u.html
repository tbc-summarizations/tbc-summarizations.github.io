<div class="discord-text">[SCENE START]

<strong>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT</strong>

The room is dimly lit, a single lamp casting a warm glow on a messy desk piled high with papers and half-empty takeout containers.  Empty energy drink cans and discarded pizza boxes litter the floor.  Empty, partially-eaten bags of chips are scattered around as well.  MEETHEXEP, clad in a faded t-shirt, sits hunched over a laptop, furiously typing.  He occasionally glances at his phone, then back at the screen.  A half-eaten bowl of instant noodles sits beside his laptop.  A faint, almost inaudible hum emanates from the laptop.

<strong>MEETHEXEP</strong>
(Muttering to himself)
Sir... I need to figure this out. This redacted diddy party...it's more complicated than I thought.  Kukirin's closed, the holiday's ruined, and now I'm stuck in this room...  with [REDACTED].

[REDACTED] sits slumped on a bed, headphones on, clearly engrossed in something. The sound of muted music comes from their headphones.

<strong>0923MINDSET</strong>
(A voice from a phone, barely audible)
Bro, what's going on? Did you see the new obby?

<strong>MEETHEXEP</strong>
(Sighs)
No time for obbies, [REDACTED]. I need to focus on this...this redacted diddy party.  It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube with missing pieces.  All I have is this, a locked room, and [REDACTED] in headphones...

<strong>0923MINDSET</strong>
(Still muffled)
Sounds intense. Is the dude going to try and make sirenhead real again?

<strong>MEETHEXEP</strong>
Maybe...or maybe it's just a normal party and I’m overthinking everything. I...I need more information.

Meethexep clicks rapidly on his keyboard. His fingers fly across the keys,  his brow furrows in concentration. He throws his head back and lets out a frustrated groan. 

<strong>MEETHEXEP</strong>
(Muttering)
This is a disaster.  Why is my phone acting weird?  A new device? Galaxy Buds FE?  I don’t even have these. Why is the door locked?  And why is [REDACTED] still so quiet?  Where did they even put the key? 

Suddenly, a loud <em>click</em> sounds from the door. Meethexep jumps, startled.

<strong>MEETHEXEP</strong>
(Gasps)
The door! Is it locked?

<strong>[REDACTED]</strong>
(Muffled through headphones)
Yeah...

Meethexep turns around to see [REDACTED] now, with their headphones off. They seem confused.


<strong>MEETHEXEP</strong>
What?

[REDACTED] looks around the room, their expression growing increasingly perplexed.


<strong>[REDACTED]</strong>
(Quietly)
I think...I think I locked the door?

<strong>MEETHEXEP</strong>
You locked it?  But how?

[REDACTED] shrugs, a slightly puzzled look on their face.


<strong>[REDACTED]</strong>
I don't know...


Suddenly, the lights flicker and die.  The room plunges into darkness, leaving only the faint glow of the laptop screen. The hum grows louder, then cuts off completely.

<strong>MEETHEXEP</strong>
(Whispering)
Uh oh.
