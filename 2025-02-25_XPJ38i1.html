<strong>Exaggerated and Humorous Punishments:</strong>

• <strong>dekodermapping:</strong>  Permanently banned from all online platforms, forced to attend sensitivity training sessions for a decade, and required to donate a significant amount of their digital assets to an anti-discrimination charity.  Their internet service provider is required to automatically filter out the word "goy."

• <strong>0923mindset:</strong>  Condemned to a lifetime of only watching streams that are exclusively about the cleaning and care of avatars.  Their avatar is forever set to the "edp" default avatar.

• <strong>henrythekazakh:</strong>  Forcibly enlisted in a 1000-person strong Kazakh band to play exclusively Ukrainian folk music at every Ukrainian embassy worldwide. The band is to be led by bdotyt in a specially designed mobile unit.

• <strong>bdotyt:</strong>  Required to drive an amphibious vehicle across every lake and river in the world, while wearing a neon-colored jumpsuit that displays a picture of each vehicle he swerved to avoid.

• <strong>andrejtb:</strong>  Assigned the role of editor-in-chief of a publication solely dedicated to compiling and distributing the entirety of TikTok's most embarrassing content.

• <strong>meethexep:</strong>  Their computer is now permanently set to play only extremely high-pitched, repetitive sounds. They are tasked with editing and translating the entire transcript of the conversation, but all of their efforts are converted into a video that is only shown to themselves.

• <strong>aj_transport_hub:</strong>  Required to write 1,000 poems about the intricacies of the color "purple" and the relationship it has with all of the animals of the world, and then read each aloud to a live audience.

• <strong>Virtual Fisher:</strong>  A one-time, non-refundable ban from all online forums for 1 year, with a donation required to a mental health charity.

• <strong>finomano5:</strong>  A lifetime subscription to a streaming service that plays only videos of people attempting to knit and crochet while simultaneously juggling.
