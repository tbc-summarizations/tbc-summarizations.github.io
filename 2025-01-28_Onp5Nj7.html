[SCENE START]

<strong>INT. SECRET CLUB - NIGHT</strong>

The air crackles with an almost palpable energy.  Neon signs flicker, casting kaleidoscopic shadows on the throng of people packed into the dimly lit club.  A DJ blasts a chaotic mix of electronic music and distorted vocals.  Bottles of brightly colored, shimmering liquids are passed around.  Security guards, adorned in elaborate, almost clown-like outfits, patrol the perimeter.  

MEETHEXEP (20s, dressed in a shimmering, slightly too-tight, neon tracksuit)  peers intently around the crowded room.  His face is a mask of both excitement and apprehension.  He nervously adjusts his headphones, which are pulsing with a faint, ethereal glow.

MEETHEXEP
(whispering to himself)
Redacted... where are you?  This place... it's buzzing with an aura of... unease.  Almost like a swarm of angry bees.

Suddenly, a flash of vibrant red hair appears amidst the throng.  It's REDACTED (20s, draped in a crimson cloak that seems to absorb the neon lights). She's surrounded by a group of oddly-dressed individuals, their faces obscured by exaggerated masks and elaborate headwear. They're chanting in a language Meethexep doesn't understand, but the rhythmic chanting feels ominous.

REDACTED
(in a deep, raspy voice, barely audible over the music)
The veil is thin.  They are close.

Meethexep gulps. He spots a small, almost invisible, portal flickering in the corner.

MEETHEXEP
(whispering frantically)
A portal... to another dimension?  This is... more than a party.  This is a cosmic dance of chaos and absurdity!

A figure in a shimmering black bodysuit, JOSH, leaps onto the bar, striking a dramatic pose, and begins to sing a surprisingly soulful opera piece.  A wave of amplified sound echoes throughout the club.

JOSH
(singing)
My soul burns with a thousand fiery suns!


A series of increasingly bizarre events unfold. A group of stilt-walkers, juggling flaming torches,  appear amidst the crowd. A mime begins performing a ballet of synchronized backflips while juggling chainsaws. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and something that smells like burnt popcorn.

Suddenly, the lights flicker violently, plunging the club into darkness. A low, guttural growl echoes through the room. Meethexep pulls out his phone, which projects a small holographic image of a menacing, pulsating skull.

MEETHEXEP
(whispering)
Sirenhead... is this real?  Someone’s trying to summon the primordial terrors from the depths of the internet!

REDACTED
(voice distorted and echoing)
He wants a reaction.  The bigger the reaction, the stronger he grows.

Meethexep is suddenly surrounded by a group of figures, their faces completely covered in elaborate makeup and masks. They gesture wildly, and a series of projections flash across the walls, depicting a battle scene between fantastical creatures.  The music swells to a deafening crescendo.  The whole room begins to shake.

Meethexep grabs a nearby bottle of shimmering liquid and gulps it down.

MEETHEXEP
(stammering)
This... this is... the Redacted Diddy Party...  and it’s about to get a whole lot weirder.
