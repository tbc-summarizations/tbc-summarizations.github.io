[SCENE START]

<strong>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - 2025-01-28</strong>

A typical bedroom, cluttered with clothes, half-eaten snacks, and gaming paraphernalia.  Fluorescent light hums overhead.  MEETHEXEP, dressed in a slightly too-big hoodie, sits hunched over a laptop, headphones on.  Redacted (unspecified appearance) sits in a corner of the room, staring intensely into the distance. The air is thick with the scent of cheap instant ramen and stale pizza.  The room is quiet except for the low hum of the laptop and the occasional click of a keyboard.

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong> (in a slightly panicked tone)
Sir, I need your help.  I think I've just gotten myself locked in.

<strong>0923MINDSET (voice chat):</strong>
Locked in? How?

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong>
It's...complicated.  I was at this party, the Redacted Diddy Party. It was supposed to be this epic night out.  Everyone was wearing ridiculous costumes—but I think the Redacted ones were...something else.  Anyway, it seemed like a normal night, everyone was talking about all sorts of crazy stuff.  Then, suddenly, the lights went out.  When they came back on, the door was locked.

<strong>BDOTYT (voice chat):</strong>
You mean...literally locked? Like, physically bolted from the inside?

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong>
Yes, and there's a weird energy to the place. I think the Redacted ones had something to do with it.  Like, a really bad, aura-based lock. Or maybe just some super sophisticated door lock. Either way it’s jammed.

<strong>(SOUND of a loud bang, followed by a rhythmic thudding from outside the room.)</strong>

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong>
(Startled)
And now there’s knocking.  And more banging.

<strong>(Redacted lets out a low growl, visible only to the camera.)</strong>

<strong>0923MINDSET (voice chat):</strong>
Banging? Are they trying to get in?

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong>
I don't know.  But I'm pretty sure they're not on our side. And now the music is so loud, it’s hurting my ears.  I’m feeling the aura of the party in here now.

<strong>BDOTYT (voice chat):</strong>
Maybe you should try the doorknob?  Just a suggestion...

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong>
Tried it.  It's stuck.  Completely jammed.

<strong>HENRYTHEKAZAKH (voice chat):</strong>
(Calmly)
Lock yourself in, Meeth? What the—are you on some kind of hidden mission?

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong>
Something like that. This is not part of any usual school event.

<strong>ANDREJTB (voice chat):</strong>
(Groans)
Ugh, now I'm stuck at school for another year. This is a disaster.

<strong>(SOUND of more banging from outside the room, now accompanied by what sounds like a distorted siren.)</strong>

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong>
(Panicked)
It’s getting worse! The doors are getting hotter!

<strong>0923MINDSET (voice chat):</strong>
Hotter? What does that mean?

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong>
I don’t know. The aura is changing. This place is not right.  I think I need to check my pulse to check my aura.  Sir, is there a way to get out of here?

<strong>HENRYTHEKAZAKH (voice chat):</strong>
(Wryly)
Probably not.  Just pray to whoever you pray to, mate.


<strong>(The lights flicker violently, then die completely.  Only the laptop screen glows dimly, illuminating panicked faces.)</strong>

<strong>MEETHEXEP (voice chat):</strong>
(Whispering)
Darkness... now… it's very silent.

<strong>(The sounds outside fade to a deep, echoing silence.)</strong>

<strong>FADE TO BLACK.</strong>
