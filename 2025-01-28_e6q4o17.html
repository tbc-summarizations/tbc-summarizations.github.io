[SCENE START]

<strong>INT. BEDROOM - DAY</strong>

Sunlight streams into a typical bedroom.  The room is tidy, with a bed, desk, and a few personal items scattered around.  MEETHEXEP (early 20s, energetic) is sprawled on the bed, phone in hand, engrossed in a video chat. REDACTED (early 20s, female) is at her desk, focused on her laptop.

MEETHEXEP
(Into the phone)
...so yeah, basically, if you don't study, you're doomed.  Like, totally doomed.  

Redacted glances up from her laptop, a slight smile playing on her lips.

REDACTED
(To herself, softly)
He's so dramatic.

Suddenly, a loud BANG echoes from outside the room.  Both look at each other, confused.

MEETHEXEP
(Into the phone)
...what was that?

REDACTED
Maybe someone's fixing something?

They both pause, listening.  Another BANG.

MEETHEXEP
(Into the phone)
Hold on, I need to check this.

Meethexep quickly exits the video chat, grabs a set of keys from a hook near the door, and heads towards the front door.  Redacted follows.

REDACTED
Hey, what's going on?

MEETHEXEP
I'm just gonna see what's making all that noise.

Meethexep cautiously opens the door to find a large, surprisingly aggressive-looking chihuahua, BARNABY, barking at the door.

MEETHEXEP
Barnaby, what's wrong?

BARNABY
(Yapping furiously)
Woof! Woof!  Door! Locked!

Meethexep and Redacted exchange a confused look.  Barnaby, oblivious to their confusion, continues his agitated barking.

REDACTED
Oh, Barnaby, you're usually so calm.  What's gotten into you?

MEETHEXEP
He's right. I think the door got jammed shut.

Meethexep tries to open the door again, but it's firmly locked.  Redacted examines the doorknob.


REDACTED
The lock's been jammed shut.  I don't think it's going to open.

MEETHEXEP
Uh oh.

REDACTED
(Panicked)
Wait, what are we going to do now?

MEETHEXEP
(Calmly, but concerned)
Well, if we can't get out, we'll just have to wait for someone to come unlock it.  I'll message Mom and Dad.

Meethexep pulls out his phone and starts typing a message.

REDACTED
(Muttering)
This is not good.

MEETHEXEP
(Calmly to Redacted)
Don't worry. We'll be fine.  Just relax and get comfortable.  We'll get this sorted out.

Barnaby barks again, then whines dismally. Meethexep shrugs and pats his head.

MEETHEXEP
Alright, Barnaby, we'll get you some water.

Meethexep and Redacted smile at each other, a moment of shared awkwardness bridging the gap.
