  <div class="discord-text">The media file is a TikTok video featuring a male individual, presumably the rapper XXXTentacion, answering an interview question about his father. In the video, the man is seen wearing a dark polo shirt with red and green accents, and he has a necklace on. His face is obscured by animated emojis, including an angry sun, swirling stars, and angry cross symbols, and the video is overlaid with a crackling lightning effect. During the interview, he responds to the question, "Do you have any relationship with your father?" with, "What's that? What's a father?", and a brief smile before returning to a serious expression. The video is credited to the TikTok user @sigmagyatskibidielgyat.</div>
