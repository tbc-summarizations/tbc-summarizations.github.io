  <div class="discord-text">The attached media file is a short TikTok video. The video begins with a close-up of a Discord profile featuring a Roblox avatar. The avatar is a cartoonish figure with blue hair and a smiling expression. A clock-like pendulum swings in front of the profile, its movement synchronized with a carillon-like sound. As the video progresses, a filter is applied to the profile picture, alternating between different colors and eventually transitioning to a Halloween theme with pumpkins and spooky decorations. Throughout these visual changes, the text "hghghghgh... Watch child po..." remains visible under the profile picture, concluding abruptly with a screen displaying TikTok's "Discover more creators" section.</div>
