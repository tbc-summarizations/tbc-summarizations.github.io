[SCENE START]

<strong>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT</strong>

The room is a typical, somewhat cluttered bedroom.  Posters of bands and sports teams adorn the walls.  A desk piled high with textbooks and notebooks sits against one wall.  Empty takeout containers are scattered on the floor.  A half-eaten bowl of cereal sits on the desk.  The only light comes from a desk lamp, casting a warm glow on MEETHEXEP, a teenage boy in his late teens, hunched over his laptop, his headphones on.  He's intently engrossed in something, occasionally muttering to himself.

Across the room, REDACTED, also a teenage girl in her late teens, sits on her bed, a phone in her hand.  She is scrolling through something, occasionally glancing up at MEETHEXEP.


MEETHEXEP
(muttering)
...so the total resistance is...  this is... this is <em>way</em> too complicated.  I need more coffee... or maybe a nap.


REDACTED
(softly)
You okay?


MEETHEXEP
(startled, looks up)
Oh, Redacted!  Sorry, lost in the circuits.  Yeah, I'm fine.  Just trying to figure out this resistor thing for my robotics project.  It's supposed to be easy but... man, this is giving me a headache.


REDACTED
(smiling gently)
Resistors?  You're making this harder than it needs to be.  Maybe I can help?  I mean, we're in the same class, and I have this handy-dandy physics cheat sheet.


MEETHEXEP
(beaming)
You'd do that for me?  Thanks, Redacted!


REDACTED
(shrugs)
It's no biggie. Just don't stare at the screen for hours straight. You'll hurt your eyes.


MEETHEXEP
I promise I'll take a break.


(A beat of silence, punctuated by the rhythmic <em>tap-tap-tap</em> of MEETHEXEP's fingers on the keyboard.)


REDACTED
(voice soft and hesitant)
You know... we have a history project due tomorrow. The one about the significant figures in our school's history.  I've already done most of mine, but... I'm stuck on the section about the student protests.


MEETHEXEP
(eyes glued to the screen)
Oh, yeah, the 2024 protests.  The ones about the school lunch policy?  I think I remember something about that.


REDACTED
(a little sadly)
Yeah... it seems so dull when I try to research it.


MEETHEXEP
(finally turns away from laptop)
Hey, why don't we do it together?  We could check the yearbook and the school archives. I've got a friend who can get some scanned material for us if you have trouble finding it.


REDACTED
(smiles brightly)
That would be amazing!  Thanks, Meeth.


MEETHEXEP
Yeah, happy to help!


(A beat of comfortable silence.  Redacted reaches into her bag, pulling out a small, slightly dusty, notebook.)


REDACTED
Hey, I found this old flyer for the protest rally. I think it might be helpful.


MEETHEXEP
(leaning forward, interested)
Wow, cool!


(He leans closer, their faces almost touching.  Redacted, feeling comfortable and safe in this moment, quietly takes out a small lock to the room from her pocket.  Quietly, and without haste, she locks the door behind her.  The click of the lock echoes through the room. )


REDACTED
(smiles gently at Meethexep)
Now let's get this history project done.



MEETHEXEP
(smiling back)
Sounds good.
