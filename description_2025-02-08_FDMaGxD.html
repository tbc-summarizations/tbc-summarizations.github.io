  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The image is a screenshot of a notification from Malwarebytes Browser Guard. The notification is displayed in a dark gray popup window with the Malwarebytes logo and the title "Browser Guard" at the top. A yellow warning icon precedes the question, "Hey, did you just copy something?" The notification explains that the clipboard has been accessed from the current website and advises the user to trust the website owner before pasting sensitive information. It further suggests that the user should be careful about pasting into a terminal or an email to their boss. A "Disable this warning for this site" option is presented at the bottom of the notification window.</div>
